This [...]"},{"title":"SimplePie is ceasing development","desc":"A couple of years ago I co-founded my first company and that has ended up taking a large portion of my time.

Geoffrey has spent a lot of time in school, building tools to help the HTML 5 community, and now has a gig working for Opera.

One of these days I&#8217;d like to relaunch it when I have more time and resources to put into [...]"},{"title":"SimplePie 1.1.3 is now available!","desc":"SimplePie 1.1.3 is now available (like 1.1.2, &#8220;core&#8221; plugin will be updated soon). This is a bugfix-only release that resolves the one major issue that 1.1.2 created (gzip decoding errors while using fsockopen()), and fully resolves the other major issue that 1.1.2 didn&#8217;t fully address (a workaround of a libxml2 bug). Grab the latest release [...]"},{"title":"SimplePie 1.1.2 is now available!","desc":"My departure was never going to be immediate, but I didn&#8217;t expect to be doing this (as Ryan always does this); however, the time has come (for me!) to announce the immediate availability of SimplePie 1.1.2 (&#8220;core&#8221; plug-ins will be updated soon).
